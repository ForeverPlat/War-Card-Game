-Start with a deck of 52 cards
    -Need to create a card with both a VALUE and a SUIT
        -There 4 suites: Spades (♠), Clubs (♣), Diamonds (♦), Hearts (♥)
        -13 ranks (values): Aces to Kings
            -Lowest value: Two
            -Highest value: Ace

-Split the deck into two piles
    -This should be randomized
    -No cards should be repeated

-Both player take a card from the TOP their cards
    -The player whose card has an higher VALUE takes both cards and puts it at the BOTTOM of their deck
        -If both cards are the same the players will:
            -Both player take three cards from the TOP their deck (This seems to be a repeated process) but will place it faced down
            -Both player take a card from the TOP their cards decks
                -The player whose card has an higher VALUE takes all the cards and puts it at the BOTTOM of their deck
                    -This REPEATS as long as the cards are the same
-This repeats until one of the players has NO cards remaining

Things that are repeating:
    -Both player take a card from the TOP their cards
        -Possible: Taking the first value from a data structure and moving all the other values up by one index
    -The player whose card has an higher VALUE takes both cards and puts it at the BOTTOM of their deck
        -Check which value is greater

Thing that may be objects:
    -Cards
    -Decks
    -Battle field

Need to figure out:
    -How are the two or more competing cards stored and compared
    -How are cards no going to repeat





------While coding-------

-Find this pretty clever
    -The to string for the cards shows if they are (J,Q,K,A), however the # remains the value


-Hands for each player are a form of deck
